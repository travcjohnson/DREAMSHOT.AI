# MyPromptBench Pivot Summary - August 4, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Pivot Overview

### From: DREAMSHOT.AI
- **Original Concept**: Track "impossible" dreams and watch their impossibility scores decrease as AI capabilities improve
- **Focus**: Personal aspirations and goal tracking

### To: MyPromptBench
- **New Concept**: Track AI prompt evolution across model releases, inspired by the "Will Smith eating spaghetti" phenomenon
- **Focus**: Benchmarking prompt outputs over time to visualize AI progress
- **Hook**: "Create your own Will Smith moment"

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Direction

### Brutalist Scientific Journal Aesthetic
- **Typography**: Playfair Display (serif) for headlines, Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for code/data
- **Colors**: Pure black (#000) on warm off-white (#FFFEF9), blood red accents (#FF0000)
- **Layout**: Asymmetrical grids, massive margins, thick borders (3-5px), harsh shadows
- **Inspiration**: Academic research papers meets brutalist web design
- **Key Elements**: 
  - Oversized headlines (clamp(4rem, 15vw, 12rem))
  - Scientific grid paper backgrounds
  - Footnote-style annotations
  - Yellow highlighter effects

## ðŸ“‚ What We Built

### 1. Core Components Created
```
src/components/features/
â”œâ”€â”€ will-smith-grid.tsx      # 2x2 grid showing AI evolution with hover states
â”œâ”€â”€ hero-section.tsx         # "Remember This?" narrative with typewriter effect
â”œâ”€â”€ prompt-input.tsx         # Terminal-style input with fake processing states
â”œâ”€â”€ results-display.tsx      # Benchmark results with improvement scores
â””â”€â”€ email-capture.tsx        # Modal for email collection with trust signals
```

### 2. Data Structure
```
src/lib/data/
â”œâ”€â”€ will-smith-timeline.ts   # Timeline data for Will Smith evolution
â””â”€â”€ example-prompts.ts       # 10+ fake prompts with progression data
```

### 3. Specialized Agents
```
agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompt-evolution-analyst.md      # Analyzes AI output evolution
â”œâ”€â”€ scientific-copy-writer.md        # Academic-style copywriting
â”œâ”€â”€ brutalist-ui-designer.md         # Component design guidance
â”œâ”€â”€ conversion-optimization-psychologist.md  # User psychology
â”œâ”€â”€ fake-data-choreographer.md       # Believable demo data
â”œâ”€â”€ will-smith-meme-historian.md     # Cultural context expert
â”œâ”€â”€ email-capture-flow-optimizer.md  # Email conversion optimization
â””â”€â”€ landing-page-performance-engineer.md  # Performance optimization
```

### 4. Design System Updates
- Modified `src/styles/globals.css` with brutalist utilities
- Updated font loading via Next.js font system
- Created custom CSS classes: `.border-brutal`, `.shadow-brutal`, `.text-hero`, etc.

## ðŸš§ Technical Issues Encountered & Solutions

### 1. CSS Import Order Issue
**Problem**: `@import` for Google Fonts was placed after Tailwind directives
**Solution**: Moved font imports to Next.js font loading system in `layout.tsx`

### 2. Dependencies Conflict
**Problem**: `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` version conflict with NextAuth v5
**Solution**: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation

### 3. Node Modules Corruption
**Problem**: Missing Next.js server files causing MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
**Solution**: Complete reinstall with `rm -rf node_modules && npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### 4. Development Error Overlay
**Problem**: "1 error" indicator appears in development mode
**Status**: Minor hydration warning - doesn't affect functionality
**Note**: Likely related to font loading or client/server mismatch

## âœ… What's Delivered & Working
