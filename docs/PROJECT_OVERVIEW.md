# DREAMSHOT.AI - Project Overview & Technical Specification

## üéØ Project Vision

DREAMSHOT.AI is an innovative platform that uses AI to track the "impossibility" of user dreams and aspirations over time. As technology advances, what seems impossible today becomes achievable tomorrow. Our platform captures this transformation through quantified "impossibility scores" that decay as AI capabilities improve.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Concept
1. **Dream Submission**: Users submit their "impossible" dreams with detailed descriptions
2. **Multi-Model AI Evaluation**: Multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude) assess each dream across 4 dimensions
3. **Impossibility Tracking**: Platform tracks how impossibility scores change over time
4. **Progress Visualization**: Users see their dreams become more "possible" as technology advances

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15.1.3 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- Framer Motion for animations
- React 19

**Backend:**
- Next.js API Routes
- NextAuth v5 (beta) for authentication
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Redis for background jobs
- Zod for validation

**AI Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini
- Anthropic Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.5-Haiku
- Custom evaluation framework with bias reduction

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel deployment ready
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching and job queues

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Models

**Dream** - User's impossible aspirations
- Title, description, category, tags
- Privacy settings (public/private)
- Status tracking (active/archived/completed)
- Original prompt preservation

**AiTest** - Individual AI evaluations
- 4-factor scoring system (Comprehension, Quality, Innovation, Feasibility)
- Provider and model tracking
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Confidence levels and reasoning

**ProgressLog** - Aggregate progress tracking
- Average impossibility over time
- Milestone achievements
- Trend analysis
- Snapshot data for analytics

**User Management**
- NextAuth integration
- Role-based access (USER/ADMIN)
- Session management

## üß† AI Evaluation Framework

### 4-Factor Assessment System
1. **Comprehension (0-100)**: How well-defined is the dream?
2. **Quality (0-100)**: How valuable/meaningful is it?
3. **Innovation (0-100)**: How novel is the approach?
4. **Feasibility (0-100)**: How achievable with current capabilities?

### Impossibility Score Calculation
```
Impossibility Score = 100 - (Average of 4 factors)
```

### Multi-Model Consensus
- Evaluations from multiple AI providers
- Confidence-weighted averaging
- Bias reduction through provider diversity
- Historical tracking of model performance

npx prisma db push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build and Deploy
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy
```

### Database Commands
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Cost Management
- Token usage tracking per evaluation
- Cost calculation per AI provider
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Background job processing for expensive operations

### Scalability
- Database indexing for fast queries
- Pagination on all list endpoints
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimized database queries with Prisma

### Security
- Environment variable validation
- Input sanitization with Zod
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- Session management with NextAuth

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Current Testing Approach
