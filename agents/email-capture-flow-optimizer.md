Step 3: "Get updates when it improves" â†’ Email
```

## Copy Templates

### Email Field Labels
- Standard: "Email for updates"
- Benefit-focused: "Where should we send your prompt's progress?"
- Urgency: "Be first to see your prompt on new models"
- Trust: "Your email (we'll only message about your prompt)"

### Privacy Messaging
```html
<p class="text-footnote">
  <span class="highlight">Privacy Promise:</span> 
  One email when new models launch. Unsubscribe anytime. 
  <a href="#" class="underline">Delete everything</a> whenever.
</p>
```

### Error Messages
- Empty email: "We'll need your email to send updates"
- Invalid format: "Double-check that email?"
- Server error: "Oops! Try once more?"
- Duplicate: "Already tracking! Check your inbox."

### Success States
```javascript
const successMessages = [
  {
    title: "You're in! ðŸŽ‰",
    body: "We'll run your prompt on every new model.",
    cta: "Submit Another"
  },
  {
    title: "Prompt #12,847",
    body: "You're officially part of AI history.",
    cta: "See Similar Prompts"  
  },
  {
    title: "Check Your Inbox",
    body: "We sent a confirmation with your prompt's first results.",
    cta: "Track Another Prompt"
  }
];
```
