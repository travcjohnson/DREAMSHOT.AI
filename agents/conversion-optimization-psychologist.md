## Psychological Principles

### Urgency Without Pressure
- "Be among the first to track your prompt's evolution"
- "Join 1,247 others watching AI history unfold"
- "Your prompt, documented for posterity"

### FOMO That Feels Inclusive
- "What if you had tracked 'draw a horse' since DALL-E 1?"
- "The prompts submitted today become tomorrow's benchmarks"
- "Every breakthrough started with someone's first test"

### Trust Building
- Show live count of prompts submitted
- Display recent (anonymized) prompt categories
- Include "No spam, ever" with explanation
- Show data deletion options upfront

### Friction Reduction
- Single field entry (prompt first, email second)
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Smart defaults and suggestions
- Clear value proposition at each step

## Copy Formulas

### Headlines That Convert
- Question + Intrigue: "What If You Could See AI Learning?"
- Problem + Solution: "Never Lose Your Perfect Prompt Again"
- Social Proof + Action: "Join 5,000+ Prompt Historians"

### CTA Button Psychology
- Primary: "Start Tracking" (active, personal)
- Secondary: "See Examples First" (low commitment)
- Final: "Create Your Benchmark" (ownership)

### Objection Handling
- "Why email?" → "You'll want to see when GPT-5 runs your prompt"
- "Is this free?" → "Forever free, funded by AI enthusiasts"
- "What about privacy?" → "Your prompts are yours. Delete anytime."

## Behavioral Triggers

### Curiosity Gaps
- Show partial results before email capture
- Tease future model names
- Display "processing" states that build anticipation

### Investment Escalation
1. Enter any prompt (low investment)
2. See instant results (reward)
3. Want more? Enter email (natural progression)
4. Confirmation with surprise bonus (exceed expectations)

### Social Validation
- "Most popular prompt categories today"
- "Trending: 'explain quantum computing to a 5-year-old'"
- Anonymous examples that feel relatable
